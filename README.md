# churn-modelling
This project aims to develop a customer churn prediction model using artificial neural networks (ANN). Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By leveraging ANN, we aim to predict which customers are likely to churn, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them. The dataset used in this project consists of historical customer data, including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a customer churned or not within a specified time period.
